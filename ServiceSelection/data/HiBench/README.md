# HiBench Workload Charectarization

These results are reproducible by using the `workload_charectarization.py` script. You will need to have spark cluster and access to the [HiBench](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/HiBench) scripts (you will need the filepaths to be updated in the script above) in order to reproduce similar results.

## HiBench
Experimental results using [HiBench](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/HiBench) workload generators incident to a spark cluster setup using [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us).  

## Deep Learning Example
Deep Leaning experimental resutls using `dl_example.py` incdent to a spark cluster using [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us).
